# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.

# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .

# No rounding or formatting is necessary.

# Example
# a = 3
# b = 5
# The result of the integer division . 3//5 = 0
# The result of the float division is . 3/5 = 0.6
# Print:
# 0
# 0.6

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    print(int(a//b))
    print(float(a/b))
